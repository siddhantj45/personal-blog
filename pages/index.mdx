# Siddhant.work

# Hi! üëã

**Thank you for visiting my blog!**


This blog is a means to share my thoughts and views with the Internet. This is just a way to help me think and learn about topics and subjects that interest me. Mainly it would be technology but sometimes I also think and read about other non-tech topics which I would like to share or write about.

**A bit about me**


I am Siddhant Jaiswal, I am a Full Stack Developer with a passion for thoughtful UI Design, Learning on the way, and exploring React, Python (Django), and Postgres at the moment. I am also working with next.js and using Vercel to auto-deploy websites. This Blog is built using Hugo and it is something new that I am working on.


I have worked on building a tech product that helps small to medium size businesses improve procurement processes and streamline day-to-day activities. Checkout [**Procflo.com**](https://procflo.com) for more details.
Procflo had to halt its development due to scalability issues but still serves existing clients. It was a great learning experience for me and I have learned a lot about team management and team building.

I hope that by visiting this blog and reading whatever I have written in the articles section, if I have even helped you 0.01% I would be grateful. Drop me an email anytime at [**hi@siddhant.work**](mailto:hi@siddhant.work)

**Let‚Äôs Learn and grow together!**
