# What's up? ðŸ‘‹


I have created blogs and deleted them over and over again, I have written articles on code, tech, networking, servers and much more. I don't have any of that content anymore. No Backups! and this time I think I'll keep some backups so I don't lose it. 

I have created this blog using Next.js and a predesigned theme. I wanted to learn more about it, So why not put it to the work. Just the bare minimum to get started. Here I'll write about everything - Tech that interests me, Something that I am learning, or could be related to something I read. This content is not shared anywhere, there is no sharing or promoting this on any social media profiles. 

If you have stumbled here somehow - let me know how you discovered this blog or about me. Send me an email - [**hi@siddhant.work**](mailto:hi@siddhant.work)


There is no specific schedule for when I post here, It's just when I want to or can. 

As Naval says - 
**Inspiration is perishable - act on it immediately.**
